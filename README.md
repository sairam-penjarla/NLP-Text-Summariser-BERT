# Text Summarizer with BERT

This repository provides a Python class (`TextSummarizer`) for text summarization using pre-trained BERT models. It offers a modular approach, allowing you to customize summarization parameters and integrate it into your applications.

## Features:

* Pre-trained BERT Model Integration: Leverages the power of BERT for effective text summarization. (Specify the exact BERT model you intend to use)
* Modular Design: The `TextSummarizer` class encapsulates text processing and summarization logic, promoting reusability and maintainability.
* Customization Options: Control parameters like maximum block length and minimum text length for summarization.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sairam-penjarla/text-summariser-bert.git
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Note: Ensure you have the appropriate BERT model and libraries installed (refer to the specific BERT model's documentation for installation instructions).

## Usage

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Important Notes:

* Replace `../input/data.csv` with the actual path to your CSV file in the `process_data` method.
* This code assumes the presence of a `Summarizer` class from an external library (like `summarizer` or `transformers`). Install the appropriate library and configure it based on your chosen BERT model.
* For detailed information on the BERT model you're using, consult its documentation for specific requirements and usage instructions.

## Further Considerations:

* Consider adding unit tests to ensure the correctness of the code.
* Explore advanced summarization techniques using different BERT models or fine-tuning for specific use cases.
* Provide example usage for various input formats (e.g., text files, APIs).
* Include documentation or comments within the code to enhance readability and understanding.
